# SimpleWarp V3

This repository contains the code for the SimpleWarp Minecraft server plugin. SimpleWarp allows you to create, delete and use 
warp points. These points are some sort of waymarks, were the player can teleport.

The plugin has also a position saving feature. Positions are like warp points except that you can't teleport there.
This feature is disabled by default.

The Position system have to be enabled first in your warps.yml config file.

The plugin also features an auto update System. This System downloads the newest version of the plugin automatically if a new version is available from [DevBukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/).

#### If you need any assistance or if you have a Feature suggestion, write me an E-Mail atÂ [support@marylieh.social](mailto:support@marylieh.social), I'd love to hear from you :)


The plugin now also features a "per-warp-permission System". 
That means if you enable `RequirePermissionForEachWarp` in your `Warps.yml` Config, every Warp Point gets an individual Permission that follows this scheme: `simplewarp.warp.WARPNAME`. 
(You have to replace WARPNAME with the exact name of your warp point). Only players with the correct permissions can see and use the warp points.
You can now set Default Warp Point permissions in the Permission.yml file. Note: Only simplewarp permissions can be set by default. Other Permissions in the Permission.yml file will be ignored. 

The new Integrated Permission Manager allows you to manage SimpleWarp permissions without the need of an external Permission System. To use this, set `IntegratedPermissionSystem` in your `Warps.yml` to `true`
Please note that only SimpleWarp permissions can be set via the integrated permission manager.
